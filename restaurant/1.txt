Build and Run Floodlight
Then, to build and run Floodlight within the VM:
floodlight$ ant
floodlight$ java -jar target/floodlight.jar
Eclipse
The VM also comes with the Eclipse IDE, which can be used to develop and run Floodlight. The Floodlight project is already imported as a project in Eclipse in the VM image, but in case you ever run 'ant clean', you can easily rebuild the Eclipse project by running the following:
floodlight$ ant eclipse
Although you should not need them (unless you remove the project from Eclipse), additional instructions on how to set up Floodlight within Eclipse can be found here.
Wireshark
The Floodlight VM comes equipped with Wireshark. You can run it by browsing to it in the Ubuntu GUI or through the terminal.
